			<p>
				The purpose of this project is to replicate and possibly enhance the work of Dr. John Snow using JavaScript and D3. Dr. John Snow was a Physician interested in understanding the Broad Street Cholera Outbreak in London in 1854; Using the same data collected by Dr Snow I have recreated visualization using modern visualization techniques
                <br><br>
				More informationabout Dr. Snow's work during the 1854 Cholera Outbreak is found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1854_Broad_Street_cholera_outbreak"> on Wikipedia</a>.

                When designing my project i was very interested in keeping the interface simple and free of flashy animation and using consitent colors. My first idea was to have a large map with all the infections with a small graph underneath showing the death by day that when hovering over would update the map above.
                <br>
                <br>
                Realizing that the screen would be better formatted for deskop view, instead of a vertical view I decided the best format would be a side-by-side design with both visualizations being the same size. This made more sense, considering the data in the line graph would be just as important and interesting as the map.
                <br>
                <br>
                In the last itteration of my designs I settled on changing how i would display deaths on the map and the shape of pump houses. I didn't like how having larger circles would crowd eachother and eventually it would be impossible to see anything.

            Rationale of your design choices: This should be a rigorous explanation of the design choices you made. For example, why did you use color to encode a particular variable? Why did you arrange your charts in a particular way?

        		<div class="subtitle">Questions and Conclusions</div>
		<div>
			<p>
            Describe how you used your visualizations to discover facts or answer questions you had. Include evidence to support your findings as screenshots from the visualization. In this case, we have a clear hypothesis to start with, but are there other nuggets of insights one can uncover?
